Using Playwright with Python, write automated tests for the following website:
https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/#/
Your tests should cover the following requirements:

1 A new todo item can be added using English text.

2 A new todo item can be added using non-English characters.

3 A new todo item can be added that includes numbers.

4 A todo item can be marked as completed and appears correctly in the "Completed"
view.

5 A todo item can be deleted and no longer appears in any view.

6 The "Active" filter correctly shows only items that are not completed.

7 The "Completed" filter correctly shows only items that have been marked as completed.

Kindly submit your code in a public GitHub repository. Please include a brief README.md file
with clear instructions on how to run your tests. This is a great opportunity to showcase your
best work.
